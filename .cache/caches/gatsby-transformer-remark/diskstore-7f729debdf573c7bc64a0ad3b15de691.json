Use a virtual machine if you need it but i can't recommend node js in Windows since a lot of the stuff you will find on google will be based on the nix* based OS.</p>\n<p>Once we have decided the os we want to use we can go to the official website an download the last version of node but again it's recommended to install by using a tool called nvm. Nvm is a tool that will help us install nodejs an move between differente versions as needed.</p>\n<p>Here you have a complete guide to install nvm in the OS of your choice <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/d2s/372b5943bce17b964a79\">https://gist.github.com/d2s/372b5943bce17b964a79</a></p>\n<p>In this post I'm going to install and run everything in a Macbook, but everything is quite similar for the rest of the OS.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash\n</code></pre>\n<p>if no errors appear you will see that it suggest you to run this command</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ source ~/.bashrc\n</code></pre>\n<p>after running this command you will be able to run nvm anywhere from the shell. An alternative to this is to simply restart the shell and the command will be also available.</p>\n<p>Then at this point we can install node js in the version we prefer in order to do that we can list the available node versions</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ nvm ls\n\n   v4.9.1\n         v6.0.0\n         v6.1.0\n        v6.11.1\n        v6.17.1\n         v8.6.0\n         v8.9.1\n->      v8.11.3\n        v10.0.0\n       v10.16.0\n        v11.9.0\n         system\ndefault -> 8 (-> v8.11.3)\nnode -> stable (-> v11.9.0) (default)\nstable -> 11.9 (-> v11.9.0) (default)\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see at the moment of writing this the latest node version is 11.9 but we can choose any one we prefer, it's usual to use versions for a lot of legacy code you will find out there. For this tutorial we are going to use the latest so we have to run this command.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ nvm install 11.9\n</code></pre>\n<p>and then we can run node js for the very first time in order to get the current installed version.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ node --version\nv11.9.0\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Finally the HelloWorld.js promised</strong></p>\n<p>Ok can you feel it ? We 're ready to go and create our first javascript file and write down our piece of art code.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ mkdir hello-world\n</code></pre>\n<p>by the way notice that the folder names is a lower case separated with dashes, this is the accepted naming convention by the majority of the node js community.</p>\n<p>Inside this folder we're going to create the js file</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ touch helloWorld\n</code></pre>\n<p>and you can edit this file with your prefered editor and type</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">console.log('Hello World!')\n</code></pre>\n<p>and in orther to run our master piece</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ node helloWorld.js\nHello World!\n</code></pre>\n<p>Ok so that's it for the moment. Maybe you're wondering, is this is the common way to create node js project properly? Not at all I would say :) The common way to create a new project in node js is by using another interesting cli tool called NPM, but this is for another quick and dirty node js guide.</p>\n<p>you can ping me in twitter @servatj any question you have, if you like it the post and you're waiting for more and so on...</p>"}
